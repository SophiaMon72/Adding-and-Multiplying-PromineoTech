This project adds, multiplies, and squares numbers.

I used Java for this project.

I had a bit of trouble deciding what to add besides adding and squaring numbers, but multiplying seemed the natural other choice! Once I realized that implementing this would be very similar to coding the adding part, I became very satisfied with what I came up with.

This project should be pretty easy to set up and replicate.

This code was completed with the help of Promineo Tech.
